# memo-thing
School project for Javascript studies.

This is a memo list where you can add memos. Memos consist of title and the text. Alert is presented if 
input fields are empty, title is too long or text is too short. Memos are saved in localstorage.

When the task is done and the memo becomes irrelevant, you can mark memo don and it turns grey and the text is overlined. 
You can also delete memos.

I would grade this project 25/30 according to evaluation criteria.
